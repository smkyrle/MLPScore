# MLPScore: A Neural Network-based Scoring Function for Classification of Receptor-Ligand Complexes
Senior Honours Project on developing a neural network-based scoring function for prediction of receptor-ligand binding

For experimental details see my lab book.

Python scripts are written by myself and Miles McGibbon.
